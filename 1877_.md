# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- I wanted to sort the list of nums first because the hint told me to lol
- Then we should map the integers starting at 0 to the integers starting at length-1 (and decrementing by i)
- Then we compare to our max pair sum and return it once we are done.


# Approach
1. First I sorted the nums.
2. Then we will loop through the sorted nums and pair the smallest integers with the largest integers.
3. Before that though, I think we should initialize and keep track of the max pair sum and also calculate the length of the nums outside of the loop instead of inside it so we don't have to find the length each iteraiton of the loop.
4. After calculating the current pair's sum, we should compare it to our current max pair sum and replace the max pair sum if our current pair sum is larger.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n log n)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$

class Solution:
    def minPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)

        max_pair_sum = float('-inf')
        length = len(sorted_nums)

        for i in range(length // 2):
            pair_sum = sorted_nums[i] + sorted_nums[length - 1 - i]

            if pair_sum > max_pair_sum:
                max_pair_sum = pair_sum

        return max_pair_sum
```
